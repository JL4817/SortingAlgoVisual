# SortingAlgoVisual

**SortingAlgoVisual** is a visualization tool that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work made using Java.  
It displays the column data and visually shows how elements move and get sorted step by step based on the selected algorithem.

## About

Sorting algorithms are essential in computer science, but understanding them just by reading code can be tricky.   
Therefore this project helps visualize how popular sorting algorithms operate in real-time.  
Itâ€™s great for learning and especially for me since I could not understand the sorts, therefore implemented them with visual. 
This makes learning also more fun!
